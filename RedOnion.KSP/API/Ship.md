## Ship

Active vessel

- `autopilot`: [Autopilot](Autopilot.md) - Autopilot of this ship (vehicle/wessel).
- `throttle`: Single - Current throttle (assign redirects to `Autopilot`, reads control state if autopilot disabled)
- `native`: Vessel - Native `Vessel` for unrestricted access to KSP API. Same as `FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel` if accessed through global `ship`.
- `parts`: [ShipPartSet](../Parts/ShipPartSet.md) - All parts of this ship/vessel/vehicle.
- `root`: [Part](../Parts/PartBase.md) - Root part (same as `parts.root`).
- `nextDecoupler`: [Decoupler](../Parts/Decoupler.md) - One of the decouplers that will get activated by nearest stage. (Same as `Parts.NextDecoupler`.)
- `nextDecouplerStage`: Int32 - Stage number of the nearest decoupler or -1. (Same as `Parts.NextDecouplerStage`.)
- `decouplers`: ReadOnlyList`1 - List of all decouplers, separators, launch clamps and docks with staging. (Docking ports without staging enabled not included.)
- `dockingports`: ReadOnlyList`1 - List of all docking ports (regardless of staging).
- `engines`: [EngineSet](../Parts/EngineSet.md) - All engines (regardless of state).
- `sensors`: ReadOnlyList`1 - All sensors.
- `ID`: Guid - Unique identifier of the ship (vehicle/vessel). Can change when docking/undocking.
- `PersistentID`: UInt32 - Unique identifier of the ship (vehicle/vessel). Should be same as it was before docking (after undocking).
- `vesseltype`: VesselType - KSP API. Vessel type as selected by user (or automatically).
- `mass`: Single - Total mass of the ship (vehicle/vessel).
- `packed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is still packed (reduced physics).
- `landed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is landed (on the ground or on/in water).
- `splashed`: Boolean - Wheter the ship is in water.
- `longitude`: Double - Longitude of current position in degrees.
- `latitude`: Double - Latitude of current position in degrees.
- `altitude`: Double - Altitude of current position (above sea level) in meters.
- `radarAltitude`: Double - True height above ground in meters.
- `body`: SpaceBody - KSP API. Orbited body.
- `orbit`: Orbit - KSP API. Orbit parameters.
- `eccentricity`: Double - Eccentricity of current orbit.
- `semiMajorAxis`: Double - Semi-major axis of current orbit.
- `semiMinorAxis`: Double - Semi-minor axis of current orbit.
- `apoapsis`: Double - Height above ground of highest point of current orbit).
- `periapsis`: Double - Height above ground of lowest point of current orbit).
- `apocenter`: Double - Highest distance between center of orbited body and any point of current orbit.
- `pericenter`: Double - Lowest distance between center of orbited body and any point of current orbit.
- `timeToAp`: Double - Eta to apoapsis in seconds.
- `timeToPe`: Double - Eta to periapsis in seconds.
- `period`: Double - Period of current orbit in seconds.
- `trueAnomaly`: Double - Angle in degrees between the direction of periapsis and the current position.
- `meanAnomaly`: Double - Angle in degrees between the direction of periapsis and the current position extrapolated on circular orbit.
- `position`: Vector3d - Current position relative to active ship (so `ship.position` always reads zero).
- `relative`: Vector3d - Position relative to orbited body.
- `velocity`: Vector3d - Current velocity.
- `centerOfMass`: Vector3d - Center of mass
- `angularVelocity`: Vector3d - Angular velocity (ω, rad/s), how fast the ship rotates
- `momentOfInertia`: Vector3d - Moment of inertia (I, kg*m²) aka angular mass or rotational inertia.
- `angularMomentum`: Vector3d - Angular momentum (L = Iω, kg*m²/s) aka moment of momentum or rotational momentum.
- `maxTorque`: Vector3d - Maximal ship torque (aka moment of force or turning effect, maximum of positive and negative).
- `maxAngular`: Vector3d - Maximal angular acceleration (rad/s²)
- `positionAt()`: Vector3d, time Double
  - Predicted position at specified time.
- `velocityAt()`: Vector3d, time Double
  - Predicted velocity at specified time.
